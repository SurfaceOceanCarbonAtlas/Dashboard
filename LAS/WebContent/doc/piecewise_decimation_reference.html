The SOCAT data collection represents a large volume of data which cannot all 
be visualized in the map images.
In order to achieve satisfactory performance when rendering maps over wide 
geographic areas, it is necessary for the SOCAT Data Viewer to reduce the 
number of data points to be displayed.  
</p>
<p> 
A piecewise-linear-approximation algorithm(*) is used to reduce the data 
volume for plotting.  
The path of a cruise is reduced to a sequence of linear line segments 
connecting longitude, latitude, fCO2_recommended triples.  
Points are omitted when their positions do not deviate from a linear segment 
connecting 3-tuples by more than 1 degree for position and 4 uatm for fCO2_rec. 
This approach assures a faithful visual representation of the ship's path and 
assures that all significant local extrema of fCO2_rec are retained.  
The reduction factor relative to the full dataset is approximately 3%.  
Maps that are based upon the reduced data report an approximation of the 
total number of points, computed as the number of points plotted divided by 
the reduction factor.
<p> 
The subsampled data is used for requests covering more than 10% of the earth 
area, when no other selections have been to constrain the data shown. 
The full non-decimated data may be requested by choosing 
"Use full resolution data set" in the Plot Options menu.
