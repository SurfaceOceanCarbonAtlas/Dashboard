<h3>Gridded (binned) SOCAT observations with a spatial grid of 1x1 degree, 12-month climatology.</h3>
<p>
A monthly climatology is computed from the 
<A HREF="SOCAT_gridded_monthly.html">gridded 1-degree, 1-month dataset</A>, so that
the data in each January for all years are combined, then all data in each February, etc. All available months are weighted equally.
</p><p>
NO INTERPOLATION WAS PERFORMED.  SIGNIFICANT BIASES ARE PRESENT IN THESE GRIDDED RESULTS DUE TO THE ARBITRARY AND SPARSE LOCATIONS OF DATA VALUES IN BOTH SPACE AND TIME.
