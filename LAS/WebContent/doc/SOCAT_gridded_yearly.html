<h3>Gridded (binned) SOCAT observations with a spatial grid of 1x1 degree and yearly in time.</h3>
<p>
A dataset of yearly data is computed from the 
<a href="SOCAT_gridded_monthly.html">gridded 1-degree, 1-month dataset</A>, so that
the data from the start to the end of each year are combined as described below.
