<h3>Gridded (binned) SOCAT observations with a spatial grid of 1x1 degree and monthly in time.</h3>
<p>
The gridded fields are computed using only SOCAT cruises with QC flags of A through D and SOCAT data points flagged with WOCE flag values of 2. The grid is monthly in time and
1-degree in longitude and latitude, with the grid defined as for the World Ocean
Atlas datasets, centered at half-degrees.
</p><p>
NO INTERPOLATION WAS PERFORMED.  SIGNIFICANT BIASES ARE PRESENT IN THESE GRIDDED RESULTS DUE TO THE ARBITRARY AND SPARSE LOCATIONS OF DATA VALUES IN BOTH SPACE AND TIME.
