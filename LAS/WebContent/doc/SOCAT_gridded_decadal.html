<h3>Gridded (binned) SOCAT observations with a spatial grid of 1x1 degree and decadal in time.</h3>
<p>
A dataset of decadal data is computed from the <A HREF="SOCAT_gridded_monthly.html">gridded 1-degree, 1-month dataset</A>, so that the available data from the start to the end of each decade are combined. Months are weighted slightly unqually - based on the number of days in that month.
</p><p>
The first decade is 1-Jan-1970 through 31-Dec-1979; the last decade is generally a partial decade.
</p><p>
NO INTERPOLATION WAS PERFORMED.  SIGNIFICANT BIASES ARE PRESENT IN THESE GRIDDED RESULTS DUE TO THE ARBITRARY AND SPARSE LOCATIONS OF DATA VALUES IN BOTH SPACE AND TIME.
